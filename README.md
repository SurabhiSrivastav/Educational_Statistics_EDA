# Educational_Statistics_EDA

In this project I have done exploratory data analysis on the dataset of Indian School Education Statistical Analysis and decoded patterns in between the varying dataset. 
Also we tried to identify the key reasons behind the dropout rates. For that we have considered the data of washroom facilities for boys and girls seperately, and computer, 
electricity and water facilities as well.

Using the dataset I have created a website using HTML, CSS and Javascript and attached the related dashboard which I have created using PowerBI tool.

Currently I am working on to make it a complete end-to-end Machine Learning project by adding a State-wise Gross Enrollment Predictor in it with the help of machine learning algorithms and Flask integration tool.
